A proposed convention for making it possible to verify that your infrastucture uses green power, by re-using existing governance structures, and already published data.

### Here's the idea

If I have a website here: https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/2019/05/03/trying-out-an-indieweb-rsvp/

Which is hosted here: https://krystal.co.uk/

I know it's _really _running here, because the CEO of Krystal mentioned it in the youtube video on that page: https://www.netwisehosting.co.uk/data-centres/green-data-centres.html

And I know they get their power from here: https://www.ecotricity.co.uk too, as they mention it.

I think there is a way to confirm this independently.

In Europe, renewable power that is generated is registered with this regulator, like this example here in the UK https://www.renewablesandchp.ofgem.gov.uk/

I can look up this up because the regulator publishes it, and because the internet is wonderful, I can make it searchable here, to see that yes, Ecotricity really do generate green power, because I can see the wind turbines the've registered.

### Walking the graph

If you have a way to identify your upstream provider, and they can update their upstream and so on, there should a way to 'walk the graph', from _all the way to the energy used to power your website_ ðŸ¤¯
