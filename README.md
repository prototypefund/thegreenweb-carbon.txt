# carbon.txt
A proposed convention for making it possible verify that your infrastucture uses green power

### Here's the idea


If I have a website here: https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/2019/05/03/trying-out-an-indieweb-rsvp/

Which is hosted here: https://krystal.co.uk/

I know it's _really _running here: https://www.netwisehosting.co.uk/data-centres/green-data-centres.html

Who get their power from here: https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/

I think there is a way to confirm this independently. Because in the Europe, renewable power that is generated is registered with this regulator here https://www.renewablesandchp.ofgem.gov.uk/

I can look up this up because the regulator publishes it.

And I can make searchable here https://greenweb-regos.herokuapp.com/regos-a486ca7/CertificatesExternalPublicDataWarehouse-csv?textbox39__contains=Ecotricity

If you have a way to identify your upstream provider, there's a way to 'walk the graph' _all the way to the energy used to power your website_ ðŸ¤¯
